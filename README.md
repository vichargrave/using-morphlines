# using-morphlines 

Morphlines example code being developed for an upcoming book tentatively entitled **Using Morphlines**.

To build this project, just go into the *using-morphlines* directory and type:

    mvn clean package

Alternatively, and perhaps more easily, you can work with this code by building a project in an IDE like IntelliJ, which is what I used for the development of this code.  To do that just open the *using-morphlines* directory in IntelliJ.
